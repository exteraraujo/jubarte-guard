# jubarte-guard-project

Overview

The Jubarte Guard project aims to raise awareness about marine life, with a special focus on humpback whales. The goal is to create an interactive and educational platform that allows users to learn about these magnificent creatures, their life cycle, and the importance of conservation. The platform will include a website and a mobile app designed to engage people emotionally and encourage them to take action in preserving marine ecosystems.

The idea behind the project:

Educational Focus: Teach users about humpback whales, their behaviors, migration patterns, and the threats they face.

Interactive Experience: Create engaging experiences like quizzes, facts, and possibly even a game to make learning fun.

Impact: Inspire users to feel connected to marine life and motivated to participate in conservation efforts.

Technologies Used

Frontend (Web): React.js

Frontend (Mobile): React Native

Backend: Java with Spring Boot

Database:

PostgreSQL (Relational Database)

MongoDB (NoSQL)

Hosting (for now): To be determined (possibly cloud-based hosting services like AWS, Heroku, etc.)

Features

Educational content about humpback whales.

Interactive experiences and educational games.

Fun facts and immersive content to make learning about marine life exciting.

Goal to create an emotional connection to the ocean and its inhabitants, encouraging people to care about conservation.

Project Scope

At the moment, the primary goal is to create a website and mobile app that will provide users with valuable information about humpback whales. Later on, additional features like interactive games and more detailed educational content will be added.

The real-time tracking of whale migration will be considered for the future, once resources and funding allow for the development of this feature.
